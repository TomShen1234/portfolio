I chose machine learning as my extended essay topic. The screenshot depicts a software called WEKA, which is used primarily to test out different machine learining algorithm. Throughout the process, many decisions has to be made between the choice of sources and the experiment to perform before taking action to do them. These decision can be difficult, including many hours of experiment results being scrapped in favor for a more reliable tool that outputs better result to support my essay.

Flowchart is a tool to visualize algorithms in computer science. This application is created by me to help people prototype flowcharts. Tools like these enables us to understand computer algorithms as beginners, it makes these concepts much easier to grasps.
