## Circuit EA

![Circuit EA Picture](../images/circuitea.png)

Circuit EA is an EA initiated by 2 of my friends and I. It is one of my collaborative project between the small team of mine. In this EA, our members will be creating cool technology-related products. Over the 5 years of this EA, we have created products such as drones, holographic clocks, and even a 3D printer. The photo above shows the creation process of the 3D printer.
