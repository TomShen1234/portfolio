## Circuit EA

![Circuit EA Picture](../images/circuitea.png)

Circuit EA is an EA initiated by 2 of my friends and I. It is one of my collaborative project between the small team of mine. In this EA, our members will be creating cool technology-related products. Over the 5 years of this EA, we have created products such as drones, holographic clocks, and even a 3D printer. The photo above shows the creation process of the 3D printer. Over the 5 years, we have progressed our EA from small projects where we work on simple circuit to large scale, whole-semester projects such as the 3D printer or the drone.

## Shaping our Future Panel

Shaping our Future panel is a panel hosted by our head of school Mr. Tom Egerton. The goal is to talk about our experiences in school related to meaningful topics (for example: innovations, technology). During the event, we can communicate with the audience, and share our experience with each other. The panel that I attended involves talking about creativity and innovations. I get to talk about a wide variety of topics and cover a variety of skills with the audience, such as working collaboratively, decision making, and explorations.
