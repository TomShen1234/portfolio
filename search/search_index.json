It is one of my collaborative project between the small team of mine. In this EA, our members will be creating cool technology-related products. Over the 5 years of this EA, we have created products such as drones, holographic clocks, and even a 3D printer. The photo above shows the creation process of the 3D printer. During each project, we have discussions where we split our members into different jobs, and we support each other if anyone encountered any unexpected problems, which is quite common when it comes to projects related to technology. Over the 5 years, we have progressed our EA from small projects where we work on simple circuit to large scale, whole-semester projects such as the 3D printer or the drone. Shaping our Future Panel Shaping our Future panel is a panel hosted by our head of school Mr. Tom Egerton. The goal is to talk about our experiences in school related to meaningful topics (for example: innovations, technology). During the event, we can communicate with the audience, and share our experience with each other. The panel that I attended involves talking about creativity and innovations. I get to talk about a wide variety of topics and cover a variety of skills with the audience, such as working collaboratively, decision making, and explorations. Solar Panel Project The solar panel project was started in grade 8, by developing a small prototype that charges one's smartphone. It is quite rudimentary, works spuradically, and is quite limited in terms of its capability. In grade 9, I once again took action by building the system shown in the picture. This is much more stable than my small prototype. Now, as the next advancement, I collaborated with Mrs. Kyrkos to bring my solar panel system to the school. However, this step requires more work than the previous ones. The challenges are no longer technological, but rather within communication and collaboration. We have to contact vendors to find the best purchase deal, then we have to contact the school's finance and engineers to ensure that the project is viable. Finally, we also opened workshops that trains younger students to also get involved with maintaining this project.","title":"Connected Learner"},{"location":"impacts/cl/#connected-learner","text":"","title":"Connected Learner"},{"location":"impacts/cl/#circuit-ea","text":"Circuit EA is an EA initiated by 2 of my friends and I.

We can use any strategies (math tools, equations, theorems, etc.) to learn more about that topic. For my math IA, I chose to explore on how the constant \u03c0 was developed. I used various method during the approach, including geometry and calculus. Exploring using geometry enables me to visualize the definition of the constant, while exploring through calculus allows me to calculate this constant to high degree of accuracy. During the process, I made use of multiple mathematics tools, in the beginning, I used a basic geometrical method by drawing multiple triangles on a paper and measuring the length, while later on, I developed a process using calculus, and programmed a computer to help me estimate the value of the constant. Student Bulletin App Student Bulletin is an app I've developed with a team of friends. This app aims to support the community in communication. It is a centralized platform that enables students to post latest news and events to share with everyone in the school. For this project, we started with identifying the need for communication within the school, then we start to develop a prototype of the solution to this problem, then we continue to iterate in order to create the solution that we have currently. There are many challenges I have encountered while developing this product. Since I never really had any experience creating a server-backed application, the first version is not quite ready to face the entire community using it at the same time. This resulted in the need to develop a brand new version, completely redesigning the backend, to make it more stable. To find solutions to these challenges, I used knowledge from both my classes, as well as online resources while designing each iteration, and improving it to make it more user-friendly to my school community.","title":"Creative Thinker"},{"location":"impacts/cret/#creative-thinker","text":"","title":"Creative Thinker"},{"location":"impacts/cret/#exploration-in-mathematics","text":"In math class we are tasked to explore an area of interest of our choice.

We are required to find out about the topic in various ways. Starting with online/literary research to form a hypothesis, then plan an experiment that enables us to verify the hypothesis. My Physics IA was centered around a commonly used device called transformer. It is a device that changes the voltage of electricity through a process called electromagnetic induction. Through this IA I got the opportunity to experiment with changing different parts of the transformer, such as the core material, and number of turns of the coil, or the material of the coil. There are lots of challenges faced along the way. For example, I started by creating these transformers by myself, however, I realized that these transformer are way too inefficient. Progresses have been made to improve the efficiency by changing the shape and the material of the transformer. However, it is still too inefficient to do a full experiment, therefore I have to make the difficult decision to not use DIY transformers, and find an existing kit within the science department to perform the lab. Math Math Analysis and Approaches class, as seen in its name, is heavily focused on analyzing the problem, and finding different approaches to reach the solution of the problem. For example, in the problem shown above, we are required to know that first we need to use the double angle identity, Pythagorean trigonometry identity, the concept of equality, and notice the domain and range of the equation to answer this simple question. In math class, I learned many problem solving skills, which I can take to other classes to solve different kinds of problems there, but applying the same skills.","title":"Critical Thinker"},{"location":"impacts/crit/#critical-thinker","text":"","title":"Critical Thinker"},{"location":"impacts/crit/#transformer-experiment","text":"In physics, we are required to explore an area of interest within the subject in the form of a lab experiment.

The screenshot depicts a software called WEKA, which is used primarily to test out different machine learining algorithm. Throughout the process, many decisions has to be made between the choice of sources and the experiment to perform before taking action to do them. These decision can be difficult, including many hours of experiment results being scrapped in favor for a more reliable tool that outputs better result to support my essay. Flowcharts Flowchart is a tool to visualize algorithms in computer science. This concepts is quite difficult for some people to grasps. Therefore I decided to take action by creating this application to help them prototype flowcharts. Tools like these enables us to understand computer algorithms as beginners, it makes these concepts much easier to grasps. Creating this application challenged multiple skills of mine. First, I have to fully understand the concept of flowchart before designing the application. Then, I have to use my product design skills to design an app with a good user-experience, and make sure it is able to complete the intended function. Finally, I have to use my algorithmic thinking skills to make the app come to life.","title":"Purposeful Doer"},{"location":"impacts/pd/#purposeful-doers","text":"","title":"Purposeful Doers"},{"location":"impacts/pd/#machine-learning","text":"I chose machine learning as my extended essay topic.
